Role: Senior Full-Stack Engineer

Context: The site design is implemented, but "Book a Demo", "Sign In", and several secondary navigation links (Pricing, Resources, etc.) are non-functional (dead clicks).

Core Objective: Make the site 100% interactive. No button or link should be "dead." If a feature isn't ready, the user must receive feedback (e.g., a "Coming Soon" toast) rather than silence.

STEP 0: STACK DETECTION & STRATEGY
Analyze the Repo: Determine if this is a Static site (Vite/React only) or a Full-stack app.

Mobile Check: Locate the Mobile Menu component immediately. You must apply fixes to both Desktop and Mobile navigations.

Data Strategy: Use existing DB if available. If not, use localStorage and mock API calls (using setTimeout) to simulate backend behavior.

STEP 1: FIX MAIN NAVIGATION (Book Demo & Sign In)
"Book a Demo":

If CALENDLY_URL exists in secrets, open it.

Otherwise, open a Modal/Form. On submit: Show Loading Spinner -> Wait 1.5s -> Show Success Toast.

"Sign In":

Create a simple /signin page.

Validate against ADMIN_EMAIL / ADMIN_PASSWORD (from Secrets).

On Success: Redirect to /dashboard.

On Failure: Show a visible Red Error Alert.

STEP 2: GENERAL LINK SWEEP (Pricing, Resources, etc.)
Scan the Header, Footer, and Body for secondary links like "Pricing", "Resources", "Company", "Learn More", etc. Fix them using this logic hierarchy:

Anchor Link Check: Does a section exist on the homepage with a matching ID (e.g., id="pricing")?

Action: Update the link to href="/#pricing" for smooth scrolling.

Route Check: Does a dedicated page file exist (e.g., /pricing)?

Action: Ensure the link points to that route.

Fallback (Crucial): If neither exists, DO NOT leave the link dead.

Action: Add an onClick handler that triggers a "Feature Coming Soon" or "Under Construction" Toast notification.

User Feedback: The user must see visual feedback that their click was registered.

STEP 3: VISUAL & INTERACTIVE POLISH
Cursors: Ensure all clickable elements (buttons, links, icons) have cursor: pointer.

Hover States: Ensure all buttons have a slight hover effect (opacity change or background shift) so they feel alive.

Mobile Menu: Ensure the hamburger menu opens/closes correctly and that all links inside it follow the logic above.

STEP 4: QA & DELIVERABLES
Click-Test Everything: Verify that clicking "Pricing" or "Resources" either scrolls to the section or shows a "Coming Soon" message.

Mobile Verification: Confirm the mobile menu links are just as functional as desktop.

Deliverables:

List of files changed.

List of Replit Secrets required.

Confirmation that you performed a "Dead Click Hunt" and fixed all non-responsive elements.
