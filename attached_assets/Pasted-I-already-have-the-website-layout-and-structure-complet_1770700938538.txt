I already have the website layout and structure completed.

Your task is to rewrite and refine all copy and UI microcopy so the entire site aligns with my brand:

Sitebloom

Sitebloom specializes in transforming outdated, slow, or poorly designed websites into modern, high-converting digital storefronts.

Do NOT redesign the layout or suggest new sections.
Work within the existing structure and improve:

Headlines

Subheadlines

Body copy

Call-to-actions

Button text

Microcopy

Value propositions

Make everything sharper, clearer, more confident, and conversion-focused.

Brand Positioning

Brand Name: Sitebloom
Core Idea: We fix underperforming websites and help them grow.
Tone: Bold, modern, confident, slightly witty (never cheesy).
Goal: Increase urgency, clarity, and conversion intent.

Avoid generic phrases like:

“We build websites”

“Digital solutions for your business”

Use stronger language like:

“Stop losing customers to outdated design.”

“Your website should work harder.”

“If it’s slow, confusing, or ugly — we fix it.”

Messaging Direction

The copy should:

Speak directly to business owners

Highlight pain points clearly (slow speed, bad UX, poor mobile design, low conversions)

Position Sitebloom as the solution

Emphasize measurable improvement (performance, conversions, growth)

Be concise and high-impact

Make headlines punchy.
Keep paragraphs tight.
Prioritize clarity over fluff.

Buttons & CTAs

Keep modern button styling with:

Slight rounded corners

Subtle hover animation

Confident action-driven language

Primary CTA must include:

“Bloom My Site”

Also generate 6–8 alternative high-converting CTA variations, such as:

“Fix My Website”

“Start My Transformation”

“Upgrade My Site”

“Rescue My Website”

Include short supporting microcopy under CTAs if helpful (e.g., “Free audit. No pressure.”).

Output Format

Provide:

Fully rewritten copy for each existing section (use placeholder labels like “Hero Section,” “About Section,” etc. if needed).

Improved CTA language throughout.

Microcopy suggestions (forms, buttons, testimonials, hover states).

A short summary explaining the overall messaging shift.

Do not suggest layout changes.
Do not change the structure.
Focus only on messaging and conversion refinement.
