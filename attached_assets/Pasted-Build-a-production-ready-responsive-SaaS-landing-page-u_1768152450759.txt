Build a production-ready, responsive SaaS landing page using **React (Vite)**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **Lucide-React**.

The design must replicate the structure and premium feel of **Juicebox.ai**.

### **1. Technical Constraints & Design System**
* **Framework:** React with Vite.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS. Use `slate-50` or `zinc-50` for light backgrounds and `slate-900` for text.
* **Accent Color:** Use a vibrant Orange/Coral (approx `#FF5A30`) for primary buttons and highlights.
* **Icons:** Use `lucide-react`.
* **Animations:** Use `framer-motion` for subtle fade-ins on scroll (opacity: 0 y: 20 -> opacity: 1 y: 0) and hover effects on cards.
* **Typography:** Use a clean sans-serif (Inter defaults).
* **Radius:** Use `rounded-2xl` for cards and `rounded-full` for buttons.

### **2. Desired File Structure**
Please organize the code into these specific components inside a `/src/components` folder:
* `Navbar.tsx`
* `Hero.tsx`
* `SocialProof.tsx` (Logos)
* `FeatureBlock.tsx` (Reusable component for alternating features)
* `AgentsGrid.tsx`
* `Testimonials.tsx`
* `FAQ.tsx`
* `Footer.tsx`
* `Button.tsx` (Reusable UI component)

### **3. Detailed Section Requirements (In Order)**

**1. Sticky Navbar (`Navbar.tsx`)**
* Fixed top, `backdrop-blur-md`, `bg-white/80`, `z-50`.
* **Left:** Text logo "Juicebox" (Bold, tracking-tight).
* **Right:** Links (Product, Resources, Company), "Sign In" (text), "Book a Demo" (Orange Pill Button).
* **Mobile:** Hamburger menu that opens a drawer.

**2. Hero Section (`Hero.tsx`)**
* Centered layout, max-width-5xl.
* **Top Badge:** Pill shape, gray bg, text: "New: Try Juicebox Agents".
* **Headline:** Huge (text-5xl md:text-7xl), Bold, Tight leading: "Win the talent war."
* **Subhead:** "Juicebox is the AI Recruiting Platform that understands who you're looking for. Level up your team with Search, CRM, and Agents."
* **Buttons:** Row with "Try for Free" (Primary Orange) and "Book a Demo" (Outline).
* **Visual Mock:** A large container below the text resembling a chat interface.
    * Input field: "Who are you looking for? e.g. Software Engineers in SF..."
    * **Floating Elements:** Below the input, position 3 "Candidate Cards" using absolute positioning or a grid. Each card needs a dummy avatar, Name (e.g., Dean Wiegand), Role (Senior Engineer), and pill tags (Python, React). Give these cards a slight float animation.

**3. Value Prop Bar**
* Simple centered text: "Recruiting is being rewritten. AI-led, precision-driven, and built for teams that demand speed and results."

**4. Features Section (Alternating Layout)**
* Use the `FeatureBlock` component 3 times.
* **Layout:** Text on Left/Image Right -> Image Left/Text Right -> Text Left/Image Right.
* **Block 1 (Search):** "Search & CRM". Desc: "Talent discovery across 800M+ profiles." CTA: "Try AI Talent Search".
* **Block 2 (Insights):** "Insights". Desc: "Real-time insights for every talent pool." CTA: "Try AI Talent Insights".

* *Note: Use gray rounded rectangles as placeholders for images.*

**5. AI Agents Grid (`AgentsGrid.tsx`)**
* Title: "Deploy AI Agents for every recruiter".
* 3-Column Grid.
* **Cards:** White bg, heavy shadow-sm, hover:shadow-xl transition.
* Content: "AI Search" (Search on autopilot), "Agentic Learning" (Gets better with every hire), "Automated Outreach" (Outreach that feels personal).

**6. Integrations (`SocialProof.tsx`)**
